## Testing Checklist (To Be Completed)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Two browser windows/devices configured
- [ ] Users signed in (Window A: User 1, Window B: User 2)
- [ ] Canvas page loaded in both windows
- [ ] Firebase Console accessible
- [ ] Developer tools open in both windows

### Quick Tests (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Test A:** Create line in Window A → appears in Window B <50ms
- [ ] **Test B:** Drag line in Window B → moves in Window A
- [ ] **Test C:** Resize endpoint in Window B → updates in Window A
- [ ] **Test D:** Both windows create 5 lines each (10 total) without conflicts

### Comprehensive Tests (30 minutes)

#### Test 1: Basic Line Creation Sync
- [ ] Window A creates line with line tool
- [ ] Window B sees line appear within 50ms
- [ ] Line properties match exactly in both windows
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Line visible in Firebase RTDB

#### Test 2: Line Selection Sync
- [ ] Window B selects line created by Window A
- [ ] Selection shows in Window B only (local)
- [ ] Window A does NOT see selection
- [ ] Selection service tracks correctly

#### Test 3: Line Drag Sync
- [ ] Window B drags line
- [ ] Window A sees line move in real-time
- [ ] Updates throttled to ~50ms
- [ ] Final position matches exactly
- [ ] Rotation and width unchanged

#### Test 4: Endpoint Resize Sync
- [ ] Window B drags endpoint
- [ ] Window A sees line resize in real-time
- [ ] Rotation updates correctly
- [ ] Width updates correctly
- [ ] Position recalculates if needed

#### Test 5: Rapid Concurrent Line Creation
- [ ] Window A creates 5 lines (5 seconds)
- [ ] Window B creates 5 lines (5 seconds)
- [ ] Total 10 lines visible in both windows
- [ ] No duplicate IDs
- [ ] No sync conflicts
- [ ] All lines have correct createdBy field

#### Test 6: Complex Multi-Operation Sync
- [ ] Window A creates 3 lines
- [ ] Window B drags line 1 while A is creating
- [ ] Window A resizes line 2
- [ ] Window B deletes line 3
- [ ] Both create new line simultaneously
- [ ] All operations sync correctly
- [ ] No conflicts or lost updates

### Firebase RTDB Verification
- [ ] Navigate to Firebase Console → Realtime Database
- [ ] Open: `canvases/main/objects`
- [ ] Verify line objects exist
- [ ] Check all properties present (id, type, x, y, points, width, rotation, etc.)
- [ ] Verify no null, NaN, or undefined values
- [ ] Check timestamps update correctly
- [ ] Verify rotation is -180° to 179° (never 180-360)

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
- [ ] Record during line operations
- [ ] Verify canvas maintains 60 FPS
- [ ] Check sync latency <150ms
- [ ] Verify drag updates at ~20 fps (50ms throttle)
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended testing

### Console Verification
- [ ] No console errors in Window A
- [ ] No console errors in Window B
- [ ] Run verification commands:
```javascript
// Count lines
useCanvasStore.getState().objects.filter(obj => obj.type === 'line').length

// List all lines with properties
useCanvasStore.getState().objects
  .filter(obj => obj.type === 'line')
  .map(line => ({
    id: line.id,
    x: line.x,
    y: line.y,
    rotation: line.rotation,
    width: line.width,
    createdBy: line.createdBy
  }))

// Verify sync latency
const lines = useCanvasStore.getState().objects.filter(obj => obj.type === 'line');
lines.forEach(line => {
  const latency = line.updatedAt - line.createdAt;
  console.log(`Line ${line.id}: ${latency}ms latency`);
});
```

## Contact & Support

### If Tests Fail
1. Review troubleshooting guide: `line-multi-user-sync-test-guide.md`
2. Compare with visual guide: `line-multi-user-sync-visual-guide.md`
3. Check Firebase RTDB service implementation
4. Verify throttling is working
5. Check network connectivity

### Common Issues
- **Permission denied:** Check Firebase RTDB rules
- **Wrong position:** Verify `calculateLineProperties()`
- **Line jumps:** Use `throttledUpdateCanvasObject()`
- **Slow sync:** Check network latency and Firebase region
- **Console errors:** See error reference in main guide

## Notes

- Multi-user sync is critical for collaborative canvas app
- All tests must pass before marking section complete
