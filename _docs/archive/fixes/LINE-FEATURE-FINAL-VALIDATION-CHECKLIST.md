**Status:** Ready for final validation

**Date:** 2025-10-14

---

## Purpose

This checklist provides comprehensive validation criteria for the Line feature before marking it complete and ready for deployment. All items must pass before proceeding to deployment.

---

## 1. Functional Requirements Validation

### 1.1 Basic Line Creation

- [ ] **Line tool activation:**
  - [ ] Click line button in toolbar → activates line tool
  - [ ] Press 'L' key → activates line tool
  - [ ] Line button shows active state (blue background)
  - [ ] Cursor changes appropriately when line tool active

- [ ] **Line creation flow:**
  - [ ] Click once to start drawing line (first endpoint)
  - [ ] Drag to extend line (preview shows)
  - [ ] Release to finalize line
  - [ ] Line appears on canvas with correct properties
  - [ ] **CRITICAL:** Tool auto-switches to move/pointer tool after creation

- [ ] **Line preview:**
  - [ ] Blue dashed preview line shows while dragging
  - [ ] Preview updates smoothly during drag
  - [ ] Preview disappears on release
  - [ ] Preview does not interfere with existing lines

- [ ] **Minimum length enforcement:**
  - [ ] Click without drag → creates 10px horizontal line (0° rotation)
  - [ ] Very short drag (< 10px) → enforces 10px minimum length
  - [ ] No zero-length lines exist on canvas

### 1.2 Line Selection and Interaction

- [ ] **Selection with move tool:**
  - [ ] Click line with move tool → selects line
  - [ ] Selected line shows blue selection border
  - [ ] Click line with other tools (rectangle, circle) → does NOT select
  - [ ] Click background → deselects line
  - [ ] Click another line → switches selection

- [ ] **Hit detection:**
  - [ ] Thin lines (strokeWidth: 2) are clickable
  - [ ] Hit area is larger than visual stroke (hitStrokeWidth working)
  - [ ] Can select lines accurately even at small zoom levels

- [ ] **Visual feedback:**
  - [ ] Hover shows appropriate cursor (move/pointer)
  - [ ] Selection shows blue border (thicker stroke)
  - [ ] Selection handles appear when selected

### 1.3 Line Dragging (Translation)

- [ ] **Drag behavior:**
  - [ ] Select line → drag → line moves
  - [ ] Position (x, y) updates during drag
  - [ ] Points array stays unchanged (relative coordinates maintained)
  - [ ] Rotation and width unchanged during drag
  - [ ] Line follows cursor smoothly

- [ ] **Drag restrictions:**
  - [ ] Unselected line cannot be dragged
  - [ ] Line cannot be dragged when other tool active (not move tool)
  - [ ] Cursor shows 'move' during drag

- [ ] **Performance:**
  - [ ] Drag updates smooth (60 FPS)
  - [ ] No visual jitter or jumping
  - [ ] Updates throttled appropriately (~50ms)

### 1.4 Line Endpoint Resize

- [ ] **Endpoint handles:**
  - [ ] Selected line shows exactly 2 endpoint handles (white circles)
  - [ ] NO corner handles (lines don't have 4-corner resize)
  - [ ] Handle 1 at first endpoint, Handle 2 at second endpoint
  - [ ] Handles visible only when move tool active
  - [ ] Handles have blue border when line selected

- [ ] **Resize by dragging endpoints:**
  - [ ] Drag endpoint 1 → line resizes from that end
  - [ ] Drag endpoint 2 → line resizes from that end
  - [ ] Position (x, y) recalculates to MIN of endpoints
  - [ ] Rotation updates based on new angle
  - [ ] Width updates to new Euclidean distance
  - [ ] Points array recalculates correctly

- [ ] **Resize behavior:**
  - [ ] Opposite endpoint stays fixed while dragging one
  - [ ] Line can be resized to any angle
  - [ ] Minimum length enforcement applies (10px)
  - [ ] Smooth, responsive resize

---

## 2. Rotation Requirements Validation

### 2.1 Rotation Range: -179° to 179°

**CRITICAL: Rotation must NEVER be exactly 180° or in range 180-360°**

- [ ] **Horizontal lines:**
  - [ ] Left-to-right: 0°
  - [ ] Right-to-left: -180° (NOT 180°)

- [ ] **Vertical lines:**
  - [ ] Bottom-to-top (upward): 90°
  - [ ] Top-to-bottom (downward): -90° (NOT 270°)

- [ ] **Diagonal lines (all quadrants):**
  - [ ] Bottom-left to top-right: ~45°
  - [ ] Top-left to bottom-right: ~-135° (NOT 225°)
  - [ ] Top-right to bottom-left: ~135°
  - [ ] Bottom-right to top-left: ~-45°

- [ ] **Edge cases:**
  - [ ] Rotation never equals exactly 180°
  - [ ] Rotation never in range 180° to 360°
  - [ ] All rotations normalized to -179° to 179°
  - [ ] `if (rotation === 180) rotation = -180` logic working

### 2.2 Rotation Calculation

- [ ] **Calculation formula:**
  ```typescript
  let rotation = Math.atan2(dy, dx) * (180 / Math.PI);
  if (rotation === 180) rotation = -180;
  ```
- [ ] Formula implemented correctly in `lineHelpers.ts`
- [ ] Rotation updates correctly on endpoint resize
- [ ] Properties panel shows rotation in correct range

### 2.3 Rotation Normalization

- [ ] **Test normalization function:**
  - [ ] Input 0° → Output 0°
  - [ ] Input 90° → Output 90°
  - [ ] Input 180° → Output -180° (NOT 180°)
  - [ ] Input 270° → Output -90° (NOT 270°)
  - [ ] Input 360° → Output 0°
  - [ ] Input -90° → Output -90°
  - [ ] Input -180° → Output -180°

---

## 3. Position Requirements Validation

### 3.1 Position is MIN of Endpoints

**CRITICAL: Position (x, y) must ALWAYS be the minimum X and Y of both endpoints**

- [ ] **Position calculation:**
  ```typescript
  const x = Math.min(x1, x2);
  const y = Math.min(y1, y2);
  ```

- [ ] **Test cases:**
  - [ ] Line (100, 100) to (200, 50): position = (100, 50) ✓
  - [ ] Line (200, 50) to (100, 100): position = (100, 50) ✓ (same!)
  - [ ] Line (300, 200) to (100, 300): position = (100, 200)
  - [ ] Line with negative coords (-50, -50) to (0, 0): position = (-50, -50)

- [ ] **Position independence:**
  - [ ] Position is same regardless of creation direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left)
  - [ ] Position updates correctly when endpoint dragged to become new MIN
  - [ ] Points array is always relative to this MIN position

### 3.2 Points Array Relative to Position

- [ ] **Points array calculation:**
  ```typescript
  const points: [number, number, number, number] = [
    x1 - x, // First endpoint X relative to position
    y1 - y, // First endpoint Y relative to position
    x2 - x, // Second endpoint X relative to position
    y2 - y, // Second endpoint Y relative to position
  ];
  ```

- [ ] **Verification:**
  - [ ] Points array contains 4 numbers: [x1, y1, x2, y2]
  - [ ] All points are relative, not absolute
  - [ ] Can reconstruct absolute endpoints: `(x + points[0], y + points[1])`, `(x + points[2], y + points[3])`
  - [ ] Points array updates correctly on resize

### 3.3 Negative Coordinates

- [ ] **Negative coordinate handling:**
  - [ ] Lines can have negative x positions
  - [ ] Lines can have negative y positions
  - [ ] Negative coordinates handled correctly in MIN calculation
  - [ ] Points array correct with negative positions

---

## 4. Performance Requirements Validation

### 4.1 Frame Rate (60 FPS Target)

- [ ] **Canvas rendering:**
  - [ ] 60 FPS while creating line (click-drag-release)
  - [ ] 60 FPS while dragging line
  - [ ] 60 FPS while resizing line (dragging endpoint)
  - [ ] 60 FPS with 20 lines on canvas
  - [ ] 60 FPS with 100+ lines on canvas
  - [ ] 60 FPS during pan/zoom with many lines

- [ ] **Mixed shapes:**
  - [ ] 60 FPS with 10 rectangles + 10 lines + 10 circles (30 total)
  - [ ] Lines perform as well as rectangles/circles
  - [ ] No performance degradation with line shapes

- [ ] **Chrome DevTools verification:**
  - [ ] Open Performance tab
  - [ ] Record during line operations
  - [ ] Frame rate chart shows green bars (60 FPS)
  - [ ] Frame times < 16.67ms
  - [ ] No dropped frames
  - [ ] Plenty of idle time (white space in timeline)

### 4.2 Sync Latency (<50ms Target)

- [ ] **Firebase RTDB sync:**
  - [ ] Line creation syncs within 50ms
  - [ ] Line drag syncs within 50ms (throttled)
  - [ ] Line resize syncs within 50ms (throttled)
  - [ ] Total sync latency <150ms (50ms throttle + 50-100ms network)

- [ ] **Throttling:**
  - [ ] Drag updates throttled to ~50ms intervals
  - [ ] Resize updates throttled to ~50ms intervals
  - [ ] Throttling prevents RTDB overload
  - [ ] Smooth visual updates despite throttling

### 4.3 Memory and Resources

- [ ] **No memory leaks:**
  - [ ] Create 50 lines → delete all → memory returns to baseline
  - [ ] Rapid create/delete cycles don't leak memory
  - [ ] Event listeners cleaned up properly

- [ ] **Resource usage:**
  - [ ] CPU usage reasonable during line operations
  - [ ] No excessive rerendering (React.memo working)
  - [ ] Network requests reasonable (throttling working)

  - [ ] All 10 lines visible in both windows
  - [ ] No duplicate IDs
  - [ ] No sync conflicts
  - [ ] All lines have correct `createdBy` field

- [ ] **Complex multi-operation:**
