## Key Concepts

### Real-Time Sync Architecture

```
User A Creates Line
       ↓
   Local Store (optimistic update)
       ↓
   Firebase RTDB (addCanvasObject)
       ↓
   RTDB broadcasts to all subscribers
       ↓
User B Receives Update
       ↓
   Local Store (synchronized)
       ↓
   Canvas Re-renders
```

**Key Points:**
- **Optimistic updates:** User A sees line immediately
- **RTDB as source of truth:** All data flows through Firebase
- **Subscription-based:** All users listen for changes
- **Throttled updates:** 50ms throttle to prevent excessive sync
- **Atomic final updates:** Critical operations (drag end) sync immediately

### Throttling Strategy

```
Drag Start → Update 1 (t=0ms)
          → Update 2 (t=50ms)   ← Throttled
          → Update 3 (t=100ms)  ← Throttled
          → Update 4 (t=150ms)  ← Throttled
Drag End  → Final Update (t=200ms) ← Atomic, not throttled
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces network bandwidth
- Prevents Firebase rate limits
- Maintains smooth 20 fps update rate for remote users
- Ensures final state is always accurate

### Latency Budget

| Component | Target | Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Throttle delay** | 50ms | 67ms | >100ms |
| **Network latency** | 50ms | 100ms | >150ms |
| **Total sync latency** | 100ms | 150ms | >200ms |

**User Perception:**
- <100ms: Feels instant
- 100-150ms: Feels responsive
- 150-200ms: Noticeable delay
- >200ms: Feels laggy

## Quick Reference

### Test Cases at a Glance

| # | Test Name | Duration | Key Verification |
|---|-----------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | Basic Line Creation | 2 min | Line appears <50ms |
| 2 | Line Selection | 2 min | Selection is local |
| 3 | Line Drag | 5 min | Position syncs in real-time |
| 4 | Endpoint Resize | 5 min | Rotation/width sync correctly |
| 5 | Rapid Concurrent Creation | 5 min | 10 lines, no conflicts |
| 6 | Complex Multi-Operation | 10 min | All operations sync correctly |

**Total Testing Time:** ~30 minutes

### Console Commands Cheat Sheet

```javascript
// Count lines
useCanvasStore.getState().objects.filter(obj => obj.type === 'line').length

// List all lines
useCanvasStore.getState().objects
  .filter(obj => obj.type === 'line')
  .map(line => ({ id: line.id, x: line.x, y: line.y, rotation: line.rotation }))

// Find specific line
useCanvasStore.getState().objects.find(obj => obj.id === 'line-...')

// Check sync latency (add to subscription callback)
const syncLatency = Date.now() - line.createdAt;
console.log(`Sync latency: ${syncLatency}ms`);
```

### Firebase Console Navigation

```
Firebase Console
  → Realtime Database
    → Data tab
      → canvases
        → main
          → objects
            → line-[ID] ← Your lines here
```

### Common Issues Quick Fix

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Line doesn't appear | Check Firebase permissions |
| Line position wrong | Verify rotation is -180° to 179° |
| Line jumps during drag | Use `throttledUpdateCanvasObject()` |
| Slow sync (>150ms) | Check network latency, Firebase region |
| Duplicate lines | Check subscription logic |
| Console errors | See troubleshooting guide |

## Support and Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

1. **Don't panic** - Testing is meant to find issues
2. **Identify the specific failing test** - Use test numbers
3. **Check troubleshooting guide** - Main guide has detailed fixes
4. **Use visual guide** - Compare expected vs actual behavior
5. **Inspect Firebase Console** - Verify data structure
6. **Check console for errors** - Look for sync errors
7. **Document the issue** - Use test report template

### Getting Help

If you're stuck after reviewing documentation:

1. Check related documentation (listed above)
2. Review Firebase RTDB service implementation
3. Verify line helper functions are working correctly
4. Check that throttling is configured properly
5. Ensure Firebase permissions allow multi-user access

### Common Root Causes

Most sync issues fall into one of these categories:

1. **Permission issues** - Firebase RTDB rules too restrictive
2. **Throttling issues** - Throttle not working or misconfigured
3. **Calculation errors** - Line properties calculated incorrectly
4. **Subscription issues** - Not subscribed to RTDB updates
5. **Network issues** - Slow connection or Firebase region mismatch

## Next Steps After Testing

### If All Tests Pass ✅

1. Mark Section 2.5.7 as complete in line.md
2. Update master task list
3. Move to Section 2.5.8: Line tool keyboard shortcut
4. Consider deploying to production for real-world testing

### If Tests Fail ❌

1. Document all failing tests in test report
2. Prioritize issues by severity:
   - **Critical:** Sync doesn't work at all
   - **High:** Sync works but >200ms latency
   - **Medium:** Sync works but has visual glitches
   - **Low:** Edge cases or minor issues
3. Fix critical issues first
4. Retest after each fix
5. Iterate until all tests pass
