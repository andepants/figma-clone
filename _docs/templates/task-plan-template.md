## Progress Tracker

Track every task as you complete it. Each task is tested individually before moving forward.

**How to use:**
- Check off `[ ]` boxes as you complete and verify each task
- Don't skip ahead—each task builds foundation for the next
- Update "Last Verified" dates to track when tests passed
- Add notes in "Blockers" section if stuck

**Overall Progress:** 0/X tasks completed (0%)
