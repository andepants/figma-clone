## Critical Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue #1: Firebase Storage Rules - File Size Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** storage.rules had 5MB limit, plan specified 10MB
**Impact:** Large images would fail in production
**Resolution:** Updated storage.rules to 10MB limit
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #2: Missing 'image' Type in Database Rules ✅
**Problem:** database.rules.json only allowed 'rectangle', 'circle', 'text', 'line', 'group'
**Impact:** ALL image uploads would fail with validation error
**Severity:** CRITICAL - blocking
**Resolution:** Added 'image' to type enum and all image-specific field validations
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #3: Firebase Storage Not Initialized ✅
**Problem:** config.ts missing Storage service initialization
**Impact:** Import errors when using storage module
**Severity:** CRITICAL - blocking
**Resolution:** Added getStorage() initialization and emulator connection
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #4: No Emulator Connection for Storage ✅
**Problem:** Dev environment not connected to Storage emulator
**Impact:** Local development would hit production Storage
**Severity:** HIGH - data isolation
**Resolution:** Added connectStorageEmulator() in DEV mode
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

2. SVG external resources - may not load
3. Very large images (>10,000×10,000) - performance issues
4. Mobile upload - varying browser support
5. CORS - requires headers
6. Max file size - 10MB hard limit

From additions:
7. HEIF/HEIC - not supported, manual conversion required
8. Cache size - limited to 50 images / 200MB
9. Mobile uploads - iOS Safari stricter limits
10. Retry limit - max 3 attempts
11. Upload cancellation - may leave temporary files (auto-cleaned 24h)
12. Minimum dimensions - 5×5px limit
13. Load timeout - 10 second limit

## Questions & Decisions Log

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Q:** Should we support HEIF/HEIC?
   **A:** No, detection only with error message. Too complex for v1.

2. **Q:** What should cache size limit be?
   **A:** 50 images or 200MB, whichever hit first.

3. **Q:** How many retry attempts?
   **A:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).

4. **Q:** Minimum resize dimensions?
   **A:** 5×5 pixels to prevent rendering issues.

5. **Q:** Image load timeout?
   **A:** 10 seconds, then show error.

### Open Questions
1. Should we implement lazy loading for images? (Deferred to v2)
2. Should we support image filters/effects? (Deferred to future)
3. Should we add image cropping in-canvas? (Deferred to future)
