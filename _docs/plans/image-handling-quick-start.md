## üìä Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Firebase configuration updated
- ‚úÖ Documentation reviewed
- ‚è≥ Emulator testing (NEXT STEP)
- ‚è≥ Rules deployment
- ‚è≥ Implementation phases 1-7

### Completion Estimate
- **Optimistic:** 24 hours
- **Realistic:** 28 hours
- **Pessimistic:** 32 hours

### Critical Path
1. Phase 0.3.4-5 (Firebase rules) ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
2. Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
3. Phase 2 (Upload System)
4. Phase 3 (Canvas Integration)

- [ ] Images render on canvas
- [ ] Resize works with aspect ratio lock
- [ ] No memory leaks (tested)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping Firebase Rules Testing**
   - ‚ùå Don't deploy rules without testing in emulator first
   - ‚úÖ Use emulator, test all scenarios, then deploy

2. **Forgetting Upload Cleanup**
   - ‚ùå Don't ignore component unmount during upload
   - ‚úÖ Implement AbortController and cleanup (Phase 2.5)

3. **Ignoring Memory Leaks**
   - ‚ùå Don't use unlimited image cache
   - ‚úÖ Implement LRU cache with limits (Phase 6.5)

4. **Missing Edge Cases**
   - ‚ùå Don't assume all uploads succeed
   - ‚úÖ Add timeout, retry, validation (Phases 1.5, 2.5, 3.5)

5. **Skipping Security Tests**
   - ‚ùå Don't deploy without testing Firebase rules
   - ‚úÖ Complete Phase 7.5 before production

```

### Key Commands
```bash
# Start emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only storage,database

# Install dependencies
npm install browser-image-compression react-dropzone

# Run tests (if test framework exists)
npm test
```

### Performance Targets
- Upload (3G, 500KB): < 30s

- FPS (10 images): 60 FPS
- FPS during upload: 30+ FPS
- Memory (50 images): < 500MB

## üé¨ Next Steps (Right Now!)

1. **START HERE:**
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

2. **Test in browser console:**
   ```javascript
   // Try uploading a test image
   // Verify it works in emulator
   ```

3. **If tests pass, deploy:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage,database
   ```

4. **Then begin Phase 1:**
   - Create type definitions
   - Set up storage services
   - Build image utilities

**You're ready to start! Begin with Firebase emulator testing (Phase 0.3.4).**

Good luck! üöÄ
