## Overview

CollabCanvas is a proof-of-concept for collaborative design tools, demonstrating the core technical infrastructure required for building multiplayer applications similar to Figma. The project focuses on solving complex real-time synchronization challenges with clean, maintainable code.

**Core Philosophy:** A simple, solid, multiplayer canvas beats a feature-rich app with broken collaboration.

**Live Demo:** [figma-clone-d33e3.web.app](https://figma-clone-d33e3.web.app)

## Key Features

### Real-Time Collaboration

## Architecture

### Vertical Slice Architecture
CollabCanvas uses a feature-based organization for maximum maintainability:

```
Features â†’ Stores â†’ Services (no circular dependencies)
```

- **Multiple focused Zustand stores**: Canvas state, tool state (not global god objects)
- **Real-time sync optimization**:
  - Firebase Realtime DB for objects (100ms sync target)
  - Firebase Realtime DB for cursors (50ms throttle)
  - Firebase Realtime DB for presence (auto-disconnect on network drop)

### Code Organization
- **Max 500 lines per file** - Split into smaller modules when exceeded
- **Descriptive names** - Files and functions clearly indicate their purpose
- **JSDoc comments** - All files have headers; all functions have documentation
- **Functional patterns** - Use `function` keyword; avoid classes
- **Feature-based structure** - Organize by feature (canvas, collaboration, toolbar)

### Real-Time Data Flow

```
User Action
    â†“
Local State Update (Optimistic)
    â†“
Firebase Realtime DB Write (Debounced)
    â†“
Firebase onValue Listener
    â†“

## Development Conventions

### Code Style
- Functional and declarative patterns
- Descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (`isLoading`, `hasError`)
- No enums; use maps or union types
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication

### File Organization
- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx`
- **Hooks**: `useCamelCase.ts`
- **Utils**: `camelCase.ts`
- **Types**: `camelCase.types.ts`
- Barrel exports (`index.ts`) in every directory

### Documentation Requirements
- File header comments explaining purpose
- JSDoc/TSDoc for all exported functions
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Examples in documentation for complex usage

### Import Order
1. External libraries (React, Firebase, etc.)
2. Internal aliases (`@/...`)
3. Relative imports (`./`, `../`)
4. Type imports (separate at bottom)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Firebase account** with a project created
- **Git** for version control

### Local Development Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/figma-clone.git
cd figma-clone
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Firebase

a. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)

b. Enable the following services:
   - **Authentication** â†’ Email/Password provider
   - **Realtime Database** â†’ Start in test mode (or use the provided rules)

c. Register a web app in Project Settings

d. Copy your Firebase configuration

#### 4. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Firebase configuration values:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.firebasestorage.app"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_sender_id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_app_id"
```

**Important:** Never commit `.env` to version control. The `.env.example` file provides the template.

#### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Build production bundle to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint for code quality |
| `npm run deploy` | Build and deploy to Firebase Hosting |

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment to Firebase Hosting

#### 1. Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

#### 2. Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```

#### 3. Initialize Firebase Hosting (if not already done)
```bash
firebase init hosting
```
- Select your existing project
- Set public directory to `dist`
- Configure as single-page app: **Yes**
- Set up automatic builds: **No**

#### 4. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Your app will be live at `https://your-project-id.web.app`

---

### Automated Deployment via GitHub Actions (Recommended)

This project includes automated CI/CD pipelines for both production and preview deployments.

#### Setup Instructions

##### 1. Add Firebase Service Account to GitHub

a. Generate a service account key:
```bash
firebase login:ci
```
Copy the token that is generated.

b. Go to your GitHub repository:
   - Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FIGMA_CLONE_D33E3` (or your project ID)
   - Value: Paste the token

##### 2. Add Firebase Environment Variables to GitHub Secrets

Add each of these as a **repository secret**:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Your Firebase API key |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Your Firebase auth domain |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Firebase project ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` | Your Realtime Database URL |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Your Firebase storage bucket |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Your messaging sender ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Your Firebase app ID |

**Why are environment variables needed?**
Vite bakes environment variables into the build at build-time, not runtime. GitHub Actions needs these secrets to build your app with the correct Firebase configuration.

##### 3. Automated Workflows

**Production Deployment (deploy.yml)**
- Triggers on push to `main` branch
- Builds with production environment variables
- Deploys to Firebase Hosting live channel
- URL: `https://your-project-id.web.app`

**Preview Deployment (preview.yml)**
- Triggers on pull request creation/update
- Builds with production environment variables
- Deploys to temporary preview channel (expires in 7 days)
- Posts preview URL as PR comment

#### Monitoring Deployments

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. See deployment status for each commit/PR
3. Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs
4. Firebase Hosting URLs are provided in the action summary

## User Flow

### New User
1. Visit landing page
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Sign up with email/password
4. Redirected to canvas workspace

### Returning User
1. Visit site (auto-authenticated)
2. Directly access canvas workspace
3. Continue editing from previous session
4. See other online users immediately

### Canvas Interactions
- **Pan**: Click and drag background, or hold spacebar and drag
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel (Cmd/Ctrl + scroll) or pinch gesture on touch devices
- **Create Shapes**: Click shape tool button (Rectangle, Circle, Text), then drag on canvas
- **Move Shape**: Select move tool, then click and drag any shape
- **Resize Shape**: Click shape to select, then drag corner handles to resize
- **Edit Properties**: Select a shape to view and edit properties in the right panel
- **Rotate Shape**: Use rotation slider in properties panel for precise control
- **Flip Shape**: Use flip buttons in properties panel for horizontal/vertical flipping
- **See Collaborators**: View cursors, selections, and resize operations of all online users in real-time
- **Real-Time Sync**: See other users' changes within 100ms

## Design Principles

- **Canvas-First**: Workspace dominates, minimal UI chrome
- **Figma-Inspired**: Minimalist design with subtle shadows and soft borders
- **Fast Feedback**: Optimistic updates with <100ms sync
- **60 FPS Always**: Smooth rendering during all interactions
- **Functional Color**: 90% neutral grays, color only for actions/states
- **Accessible**: Keyboard shortcuts, semantic HTML, ARIA labels

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `main` - Production code
- `feature/[name]` - New features
- `fix/[name]` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/[scope]` - Code refactoring
- `docs/[topic]` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): brief description

Examples:
feat(canvas): add circle shape support
fix(auth): resolve login redirect loop
refactor(hooks): split useCanvas into smaller hooks
docs(readme): update deployment instructions
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with clear commits
3. Push to GitHub (triggers preview deployment)
4. Open PR with description of changes
5. Review preview deployment URL
6. Merge to `main` (triggers production deployment)

## Firebase Security Rules

### Realtime Database Rules
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "canvases": {
      "$canvasId": {
        "objects": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null"
        },
        "cursors": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          "$userId": {
            ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
          }
        },
        "presence": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          "$userId": {
            ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure:
- Only authenticated users can access canvas data
- Users can only write their own cursor and presence data
- All users can read shared canvas objects

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Working in Production
**Problem:** Error: "Missing required environment variable: VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY"

**Solution:**
1. Verify all Firebase environment variables are added as GitHub Secrets
2. Check that workflow files include `env:` block in build step
3. Rebuild and redeploy after adding secrets

### Presence Not Updating
**Problem:** Users appear online but don't disconnect when they leave

**Solution:**
- Firebase Realtime Database handles disconnection automatically via `onDisconnect()`
- Check Firebase Console â†’ Realtime Database â†’ Data to verify presence nodes
- Ensure users are authenticated (presence requires auth)

### Canvas Objects Not Syncing
**Problem:** Shapes created by one user don't appear for others

**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase Realtime Database rules allow authenticated read/write
2. Verify `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
3. Check browser console for Firebase permission errors
4. Ensure all users are viewing the same canvas ID (hardcoded to "main" currently)
