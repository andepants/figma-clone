/**
 * @fileoverview FAQ section for pricing page with collapsible accordion.
 *
 * UX Principles:
 * - Progressive Disclosure: Collapsible Q&A items (one open at a time)
 * - Error Resilience: Answer common objections and concerns
 * - Reduce Cognitive Load: Plain language, no jargon
 * - Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management
 *
 * Features:
 * - Accordion-style FAQ (only one answer visible at a time)
 * - Smooth expand/collapse animations
 * - Chevron indicator rotates when expanded
 * - Hover states for interactive feel
 * - Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to toggle)
 *
 * @example
 * <PricingFAQ />
